// Exercise 1.7.5

// Step 1: Declare two variables, 'dividend' with the value 27 and 'divisor' with the value 4.
// Write your code below
let dividend = 27;
let divisor = 4;



// Step 2: Declare a variable named 'remainder' and find the remainder when 'dividend' is divided by 'divisor'.
// Write your code below

let remainder = dividend % divisor;


// Don't change the code of the console.log()
console.log(`The remainder of 'dividend' divided by 'divisor' is: `, remainder);
// Expected Output: The remainder of 'dividend' divided by 'divisor' is:  3
