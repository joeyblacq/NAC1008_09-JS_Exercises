// Exercise 1.4.1

// Step 1: Declare two variables, 'firstName' with the value 'Alice' and 'lastName' with the value 'Smith'.
// Write your code below
let firstName = 'Alice';
let lastName = 'Smith';



// Step 2: Concatenate them to create a variable named 'fullName'.
    // Hint: You can concatenate strings with the '+' operator OR the 'concat()' method OR using ${}.
// Write your code below



const fullName = firstName +  ' '  + lastName;

// Don't change the code of the console.log()
console.log(`Her first name is ${firstName} and her last name is ${lastName}, she is ${fullName}`);
// Expected Output: Her first name is Alice and her last name is Smith, she is Alice Smith
